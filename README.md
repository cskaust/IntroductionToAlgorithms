# IntroductionToAlgorithms
I am taking the Introduction To Algorithms(6.006) , Lectured by Prof. Erik Demaine & Prof. Srini Devadas on MIT OPENCOURSEWARE. 

The book I will be completing hopefully page to page during the course of this elective will be {Cormen, Thomas, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, and Clifford Stein. Introduction to Algorithms. 3rd ed. MIT Press, 2009. ISBN: 9780262033848.} "INTRODUCTION TO ALGORITHMS". Well i have bought a reprinted local edition online for a few bucks because the original one costs a fortune. Anyways,I will be posting my solutions to that book frequently on this repository and also might upload other related code and notes during the course of watching the lectures...

Let me know if you have done a similar code or even this same exact course!

You may fork thus repo and add some of your lecture notes,problem solutions and other awesome course related things too:)

bye bye!!
